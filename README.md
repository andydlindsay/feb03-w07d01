### Closures
- when the function has access to variables that were in scope when the function was declared
- React Hooks give us access to closures

### What is React?
- A JavaScript library for creating UI Components
- Declarative => asking it politely to do something for us
- React is charge of the state, you just tell me how the state changes, and how to render components based on state
- State === data (strings, booleans, objects, arrays, etc)
- Not limited to the browser, react-native, react-cli (INK)
- React-DOM

### NPX vs NPM
- NPM installing packages
- npm i -g create-react-app
- npx create-react-app <project-name>
